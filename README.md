# Encryption

## More about the Project
In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding (convert into a coded form) information. This technique transforms the information's initial plaintext representation into an alternate version known as ciphertext. In an ideal world, only people with the proper credentials may convert ciphertext to plaintext and access the original data. 
## Manual for the Project

Encryption algorithm used (DES, AES, etc.) to encrypt a file
- The user must first register in order to use the program.
- It can encrypt a photo, text file and rar file.
- Uses a hash as a password.
- Uses self created encryption algorithm.
- Removes unencrypted files after encryption.
